Windows 10 & 11:
{
   1. Install python 3.12 or later from the Microsoft store and from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   2. Run Setup.exe
   3. Select the folder you want hosted
   4. Profit/Enjoy lol
   5. You only need to run the setup file once. All other times start the application from the .application file.

   Extras
   1. If you want to close the file server simply go into task manager and search python then "End Task" this also helps if the server isn't 
      showing for some reason. Please also don't use a VPN as that could break it.

   2. If you are having trouble getting the server to laucnh make sure you don't have multiple wifi connections running all at once.
